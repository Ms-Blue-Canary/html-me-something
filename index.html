    <center><p class=poem>As may be seen on picture here,
    <br>
    Rome the doctors do appear,
    <br>
    When to their patients they are called,
    <br>
    In places by the plague appalled,
    <br>
    Their hats and cloaks, of fashion new,
    <br>
    Are made of oilcloth, dark of hue,
    <br>
    Their caps with glasses are designed,
    <br>
    Their bills with antidotes all lined,
    <br>
    That foulsome air may do no harm,
    <br>
    Nor cause the doctor man alarm,
    <br>
    The staff in hand must serve to show
    <br>
    Their noble trade where'er they go</p></center>
    
    <p>So goes the popular 17th century poem engraved on the picture above. While <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/49217/anatomy-14th-century-bubonic-plague-hazmat-suits"> every part of the plague doctor's outfit served a specific purpose in protecting the wearer</a> from the epidemic known as the Black Death, few would argue that the beaked masks, wide brimmed hats, and long leather gowns did not present a rather ominous figure. Indeed, one does not have to struggle to conjure up a resemblance between these doctors and infamous image of the black-cloaked manifestation of death itself, the Grim Reaper. Being in the presence of such a doctor must have been a worrying event, for a multitude of reasons.</p>
    
    <p>Thankfully, while a fairly common sight in the days of the Bubonic plague outbreaks across Europe, in the days of modern sanitation the plague doctor is understandably a less common sight in the 21st century. Or, rather, they were up until the night of Sunday July 23, 2017 in the small English town of Yirsperth.</p>
    
    <p>The following is the story of the first recorded encounter of the entity that has come to be known as the Yirsperth Plague Doctor.</p>
    
    <center><h3>Rory Wise's Encounter:</h3></center>
    
    <p>Rory Wise, age 31 and a life-long resident of Yirsperth, was bicycling home from a late night working at his grocery store, peddling along his usual route when he rounded a bend and was surprised to find a tall figure standing in the middle of the path.</p>
    
    <p>"I didn't expect to see anyone," Mr. Wise explained to journalists later. "It was late--I locked up around quarter-past ten, and I figure I must have been riding for ten minutes, so it was getting on eleven. And it was starting to drizzle a bit. I remember wondering, 'What is anyone doing out?'"</p>

    <p>Mr. Wise said hadn't planned on slowing down and was simply going to ride around the individual, but that all changed when he peddled closer. A wave of terror washed over him, which he described as feeling like he had been punched in the chest.</p>
    
    <p>"It knocked me off my bike--literally," Mr. Wise said. "I lost control and went tumbling to the dirt.</p>
    
    <p>"And I couldn't get up. I was like stumbling all over myself and the bicycle, trying to run away to goodness-knows-where. I was that scared. I just wanted to run away from that... thing."</p>
    
    <p>The clamor caused by Mr. Wise seemed to have attracted the attention of the figure standing in the path ahead. It turned toward him and he was able to see some of it thanks to the light from a nearby streetlamp.</p>
    
    <p>"She looked exactly like a bloody beak doctor!" Mr. Wise stated. "A part of me wondered if this was some kids playing a joke, but I swear on my honor that she wasn't human."</p>
    
    <p>The bit of the costume he was able to recall in his panic certainly brought to mind an otherwise typical plague doctor--a wide-brimmed hat and dark cloak along with a whitish beaked mask inlaid with eye pieces of red glass. However, he described the figure as having an unearthly aura about it that radiated an absolutely primal fear.</p>
    
    <p>Mr. Wise said he was frozen on the spot and that the entity tilted its head and stared at him, almost as though it was curious about his presence. It didn't speak, but it made a sound described as throaty and distorted and completely inhuman.</p>
    
    <p>"I don't even--it sounded like--[Here Mr. Wise attempted to demonstrate the sound, resulting in croaking noise.] See, I can't even do it. How she managed it is beyond me, but that was enough. I was gone."</p>
    
    <p>Abandoning his bike, Mr. Wise fled back the way he came and to his store where he called his wife and camped out until she was able to come pick him up.</p>
    
    <p>"Sarah [Mr. Wise's wife] said I was bone-white and shaking like mad. I told her what I'd seen and she... sort of laughed it off, saying I must have seen someone leaving a fancy dress party or something and got scared over nothing. I didn't back down. I said, 'Why would someone be out in the rain in their costume?'And I described her--that thing--to Sarah a hundred times, and how I knew she wasn't a person. She couldn't have been."</p>
    
    <p>A notable detail in Mr. Wise's description of the entity was questioned at this point--why did he keep referring to the plague doctor he encountered as female?</p>
    
    <p>"I... I don't know,"  Mr. Wise answered after a long moment, seeming confused. "I... Most doctors back then were men, weren't they? Most beak doctors were men? And, and... Nothing I saw really... indicated that the thing I saw was a man or a woman or something else, but it's like I <i>know</i> she's a 'she'..."</p>
    
    <p>That odd detail was also a sentiment shared by others who have encountered the plague doctor entity.<p>
